 My try at the exercise at freeCodeCamp for creating a local weather app. 
I used Google's Maps API to geocode the users search term. I then used Forecast IO's API to grab hold of weather information. Users can click on any of the seven days and read a quick summary on the predicated weather forecast for that day.
